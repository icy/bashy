## Description

It's a collection of my `Bash` utils and functions and stuff.
It can be used for educational purpose, or any purpose.

* [gk8s](bin/gk8s): A Bash script to manage multiple k8s clusters,
  especially helpful for scripting purpose. It also helps to avoid
  accidental deletion by locking dangerous actions by default.
* [git_push_to_all_remotes](libs/git.sh): Push your code to all remotes,
  but skipping the remote you don't have permissions, and/or skip any
  protected/personal branches. And a few convenient shortcuts for `git`.
* [ps1.sh](libs/ps1.sh): Well, I have been using this PS for more than 10 years.
