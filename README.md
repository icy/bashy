## HsabyMhO - OhMyBash

Do you know why? It's because

    echo "Oh My Bash" | perl -ne 'chomp;print scalar reverse;'

will return the original name.

How to pronounce it? I don't know. Let's mute all `h`, so it's `/sabymo/`.

## What it is

It's a collection of my `Bash` utils and functions and stuff.
It can be used for educational purpose, or any purpose.
